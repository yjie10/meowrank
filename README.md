## 💬 About

🐾 meowrank 🐾 is a mini React project built to refresh my React skills, explore localStorage and have some fun with cat-themed UI.
Features include **upvote**, **sorting** and data saving via **localStorage** (as mentioned in Features). It's a simple app, but hope you feel the cat 🐈‍⬛ vibes it's trying to express (😂).
